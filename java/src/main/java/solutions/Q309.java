/**
 * Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
 *
 * Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and
 * sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:
 *
 * You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
 * After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cool down 1 day)
 *
 * Example:
 *  prices = [1, 2, 3, 0, 2]
 *  maxProfit = 3
 *  transactions = [buy, sell, cool down, buy, sell]
